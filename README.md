## Frontend JS Demos

These are open source example projects using frontend frameworks and a mix of different backend solutions. These projects may or may not be modified from pre-existing examples on the web.

- [plain-react](https://testdriven.io): test driven development course adapted for plain django (none-rest)
- [prest-react](/prest-react): experimental react/prest stack with explicit JWT authentication as a proof of concept.
- [postgrest-react](/postgrest-react): experimental react/postgrest stack with role based authentication through JWT
- [postgrest-rls](/postgrest-rls): experimental postgrest stack with hierarchical role based authentication through JWT and postgres row level security (database heavy configurations)
- [postgrest-elm](/postgrest-elm): experimental mix of postgrest and elm
